#### 1. **Accessibility, Use Cases, Scenarios, Personas - 25 points:**
In class we learned about accessibility, use cases, user stories, scenarios, personas, and many other important concepts that we should consider during all stages of user interface design. The following questions will test your knowledge of these concepts.
i. What do each of the following acronyms represent:

    * UCD: User Centred Design
    * WIMP: Window, Icons, Menu and Pointers
    * AOI: Aplication Oriented Iterface
    * OOUI: Oriented Objected User Interface
    * UX: User Experience
    * QUIS: Questionnaire For User Interaction Satisfaction
    * AX: Attentional Experience
    * AODA: Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act

ii. What are the 4 elements of UCD:

    1. Visibility
    2. Accessbility
    3. Legibility
    4. Language

iii. Considering the *users* of McDonald's restaurants, would you classify Ronald McDonald as a Major, Minor, or Anti Persona? Justify your response.

     None, Ronald isn't a persona because it does not represent any personas of the 

iv. Consider the following: It’s the day of the big exam and Sarah just awoke to the realization that she overslept. After rushing around trying to make herself some breakfast (and spilling her coffee all over the kitchen floor), Sarah finds herself running to catch the bus. Out of breath, she boards the standing room only bus and is almost knocked over by another student who is trying to navigate to the back of the bus. After regaining her footing, she realizes that she doesn’t know where her exam is so pulls out her smart phone to check the University of Guelph’s website. Sadly the signal on the bus isn’t that strong so Sarah has difficulty navigating to the information she needs. The movement of the bus also makes typing while maintaining balance rather difficult. After several minutes fumbling with her phone, and after entering the wrong search term several times (due to the motion of the bus), she manages to find that her exam is in MacNaughton room 113. She arrives with 5 minutes to spare - enough time to pull out the necessary materials to begin the exam. 

In class we talked about 3 things that can influence UX. What are they?

    1. User's state/experience
    2. Context or situation
    3. Properties of the system

v. Identify examples from Sarah’s morning that demonstrate each of the 3 things that can influence UX.

    1. User's state/experience: Sarah was late to the test, and ran to catch the bus. 
    2. context or situation:  she boards the stanting room only bus and is almost knocked over by another student.
    3. Properties: The signal on the bus isn't that strong.

vi. Despite her terrible day, how might you improve the University of Guelph’s website so that Sarah’s UX is improved? That is, considering each of the items that influence UX, identify how the design of the website could be improved so that Sarah has a positive (or at least not negative) experience.

    1. light website
    2. suggestions when searching
    3. button to see the test's rooms right in the front page.

#### 2. GUI Types and Tools 
In class we discussed different types of GUIs and six tools used to help create well designed GUIs. The following question will test your knowledge of these, as well as the conversations held in class about these tools.

-  i. List and rank all six of the tools discussed in class. Rank the tools based on when you should implement each of them. That is, assign a 1 to the tool you would use first, a 2 to the tool you would use second, etc. Ties are not permitted.

    * Card Sorting
    * Flow Charting
    * Story Boarding
    * Paper Prototype
    * Wire Framing
    * Wizard of Oz'ing

    ii.

- iii.
    * Card sorting
        * Put the words from the board in categories
    * Flow charting
        * Used in A3 to show how the app worked
    * Story Boarding
        * Show in the class for the pong game
    * Paper Prototype
        * In the Lab 8 we created the paper prototype for the Appleseed Collective app
    * Wire Framing
        * Also in Lab 8 we made a wire framing
    * Wizard of Oz'ing
        * not done

- iv.
    * What was missing from the Paper Prototyping session that we watched?

             > was an example of a poor paper prototyping
             session, because the user did not describe aloud what they were doing
             during the session.

    * Identify four rules to Paper Prototyping.
        * Introduce yourself and your team to the used
        * describe what is expected from the user,
        * describe the team role
        * describe aloud what they were doing during the session.
    * What are two types of information that Paper Prototyping can provide the design team?
        * Paper prototypes can be used for usability testing with real users.
        * About the design of the product, if it is good


# 3. Software Evaluation 

v. What are three things that error handling should do?
    * Tell the user how to recover from that error 
    * Save the Correct answers 
    * Make sure to the user whats going on
